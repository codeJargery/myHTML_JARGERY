        <h2>Bawumia fires back and rejects tribal, religious attacks in NPP race</h2>
        <p>Former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has reacted to what he described as “unfortunate” tribal and religious attacks against his bid to lead the New Patriotic Party (NPP) to the 2028 general election.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the 33rd anniversary celebration of United States of America branch of the NPP in New York, Dr Bawumia expressed disappointment that some of his internal rivals had resorted to what he called “bigotry” in their campaign messages. He maintained that such comments did not reflect the true values of the NPP.</p>

            <p>The 12-track project, unveiled with a cinematic trailer directed by Alex Piper, captures Gyakie’s evolution from a gifted child of music to a global star in her own right.</p>
            <p>“AFTER MIDNIGHT” blends soulful melodies with Afrobeats and R&B influences, featuring powerhouse collaborations with Young Jonn, 6LACK, Shatta Wale, Omar Sterling, Headie One, and Kojey Radical.</p>
            <p>Poised as her most defining body of work, “AFTER MIDNIGHT” solidifies Gyakie’s voice as one of Africa’s most resonant and emotionally powerful today.</p>

        <h2>Which Google Pixel Phone Should You Buy?</h2>
        <p>Pixel 10 or Pixel 9a? Here’s a guide to all the models—plus Pixel case recommendations and smart software tricks to try</p>
        <img src="pixel1.png" loading="lazy" width="600" alt="A display the rear camera of Pixel some dvices ">
        <p>Google’s Pixel 9a (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is all the phone most people need. The 6.3-inch screen might not be as compact as its predecessor, but it doesn't feel too big. There's a new design to give the A series its own look, though the iris and peony colors are doing some heavy lifting. In black or white, it's fairly dull. At least you get a camera module that doesn't stick out.</p>
